# Escalations Display Fix - Resolved Tickets Issue ✅

## Problem Identified
**Issue:** Resolved/Closed tickets were still appearing in the "Active Escalations" section of the ICT GM Dashboard.

**Example:** Ticket `NDB-0001` with status "Resolved" was showing in Active Escalations, causing confusion.

## Root Cause
The escalations query was fetching **ALL** tickets where `escalated == 1`, regardless of their current status. This meant that tickets which had been escalated but later resolved/closed were still appearing in the Active Escalations list.

### Original Code (Bug)
```python
# Query escalated tickets (SLA breached)
escalated_query = db.query(Ticket).filter(Ticket.escalated == 1)
```

This query retrieved every ticket that had ever been escalated, including:
- ✅ Open escalations (correct)
- ✅ In Progress escalations (correct)
- ❌ Resolved escalations (INCORRECT - should be hidden)
- ❌ Closed escalations (INCORRECT - should be hidden)

## Solution Implemented
Added a filter to **exclude** resolved and closed tickets from the Active Escalations section.

### Fixed Code
```python
# Query escalated tickets (SLA breached) - EXCLUDE resolved/closed tickets
escalated_query = db.query(Ticket).filter(
    Ticket.escalated == 1,
    Ticket.status.notin_([TicketStatus.RESOLVED, TicketStatus.CLOSED])  # Only show open escalations
)
```

## What Changed

### Before Fix
- Active Escalations showed tickets with `escalated == 1` **regardless of status**
- Resolved/Closed escalated tickets appeared in the list
- Confusing for ICT GM (why is a resolved ticket showing as escalation?)
- Active Escalations count included resolved tickets

### After Fix
- Active Escalations **only** show:
  - Status: OPEN ✅
  - Status: IN_PROGRESS ✅
  - Status: WAITING_ON_USER ✅ (if escalated)
- Resolved/Closed escalated tickets are **automatically removed**
- Clear, actionable list for ICT GM
- Accurate escalations count

## Business Logic

### Escalation Lifecycle
1. **Ticket Created** → `escalated = 0`
2. **SLA Breached** → `escalated = 1` (appears in Active Escalations)
3. **Technician Resolves** → `status = RESOLVED`
4. **Auto-Removed** → No longer shows in Active Escalations ✅

### Key Principle
**Active Escalations = Tickets requiring attention**

Once a ticket is resolved/closed, it no longer requires escalation attention, even if it was previously escalated.

## Technical Details

### File Modified
`app/api/escalations.py` - Line ~28-32

### Query Filter Logic
```python
Ticket.status.notin_([TicketStatus.RESOLVED, TicketStatus.CLOSED])
```

This SQLAlchemy filter translates to SQL:
```sql
WHERE escalated = 1 
  AND status NOT IN ('resolved', 'closed')
```

### Status Enum Values
```python
class TicketStatus(str, Enum):
    OPEN = "open"
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
    WAITING_ON_USER = "waiting_on_user"
    RESOLVED = "resolved"       # ← Excluded from escalations
    CLOSED = "closed"           # ← Excluded from escalations
```

## Impact on Dashboard

### ICT GM Dashboard - Active Escalations Section
**Before:**
- Shows: 1 Active Escalation (NDB-0001, status: Resolved) ❌
- Confusing state

**After:**
- Shows: 0 Active Escalations ✅
- Clean, accurate view

### What Still Shows in Escalations
- Open tickets with breached SLA ✅
- In Progress tickets with breached SLA ✅
- Waiting on User tickets (if escalated before pause) ✅

### What NO Longer Shows
- Resolved escalated tickets ❌
- Closed escalated tickets ❌

## Historical Data Preservation

**Important:** This fix does NOT delete escalation records!

- The `escalated` flag remains `1` in the database
- The `SLAEscalation` table records are preserved
- Reports can still query historical escalations
- Only the **active view** is filtered

### For Historical Reporting
You can still query all escalations (including resolved) by directly querying:
```python
all_escalations = db.query(Ticket).filter(Ticket.escalated == 1).all()
```

This is useful for:
- Performance reports ("How many tickets escalated this month?")
- Trend analysis
- SLA compliance metrics
- Audit trails

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Resolved Escalated Ticket
1. Create urgent ticket
2. Wait for SLA breach (escalates)
3. Verify appears in Active Escalations ✅
4. Resolve the ticket
5. **Expected:** Ticket removed from Active Escalations ✅
6. **Actual:** Works correctly ✅

### Test Case 2: Closed Escalated Ticket
1. Take escalated ticket
2. Close it
3. **Expected:** Removed from Active Escalations ✅
4. **Actual:** Works correctly ✅

### Test Case 3: In Progress Escalation
1. Escalated ticket in "In Progress" status
2. **Expected:** Still shows in Active Escalations ✅
3. **Actual:** Works correctly ✅

## Related Systems

### SLA Monitor (Not Affected)
The SLA Monitor continues to work as before:
- Creates escalation when SLA breaches
- Sets `escalated = 1`
- Creates `SLAEscalation` record
- This fix only affects **display**, not escalation creation

### Paused Tickets (Works Together)
- Paused tickets (WAITING_ON_USER) show in separate section
- If a paused ticket was escalated before being paused, it won't show in Active Escalations
- Once resumed and resolved, it's removed from all escalation views

## User Experience

### For ICT GM
- **Cleaner dashboard** - only actionable items
- **No confusion** - resolved tickets don't appear as problems
- **Accurate metrics** - Active Escalations count is trustworthy
- **Better decision making** - focus on real issues

### For Technicians
- **No change** - workflow remains the same
- Resolving a ticket automatically removes it from GM view
- Clear indication that issue is resolved

## Future Considerations

### Auto-Close Workflow (Future Enhancement)
Could add automatic closure of resolved tickets:
```python
# After X days in RESOLVED status → auto-change to CLOSED
if ticket.status == RESOLVED and days_since_resolved > 7:
    ticket.status = CLOSED
```

### Escalation History View (Future Enhancement)
Could add separate view for historical escalations:
- "Active Escalations" (current fix applies)
- "Resolved Escalations" (historical view)
- Useful for learning/review

## Files Changed
1. ✅ `app/api/escalations.py` - Added status filter to escalations query

## Deployment
- **Applied:** October 18, 2025
- **Server:** Restarted (PID 2684)
- **Status:** 🟢 Live in production

## Status
**🟢 FIXED** - Resolved/Closed tickets no longer appear in Active Escalations.
