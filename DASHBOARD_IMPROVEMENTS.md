# DASHBOARD & BRANDING IMPROVEMENTS

## ‚úÖ **Changes Implemented**

### 1. **Dashboard Now Shows Tickets**

All role-specific dashboards now display recent tickets after creation:

#### **Admin Dashboard:**
- 4 metric cards (Total, Open, Resolved Today, Urgent)
- **Recent Tickets** section showing latest 5 tickets
- Clickable ticket rows to view details

#### **Helpdesk Officer Dashboard:**
- 2 metric cards (Tickets Created, Pending)
- Quick action: "Create New Ticket" button
- **Recent Tickets** section showing latest 5 tickets created

#### **Technician Dashboard:**
- Displays technician specialization type
- 3 metric cards (Assigned to Me, In Progress, Urgent)
- **My Assigned Tickets** section showing all assigned tickets
- Filters to show only tickets assigned to logged-in technician

### 2. **New Ticket Display Features**

Each ticket in the dashboard shows:
- **Ticket Number** (e.g., NDB-0001) - in blue, clickable
- **Problem Summary** - main issue description
- **User Name** and **Created Date**
- **Priority Badge** - color-coded (Urgent=red, High=orange, Normal=green)
- **Status Badge** - color-coded (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)

### 3. **Interactive Ticket Rows**
- Hover effect with light blue background
- Click any ticket to open detail modal
- Responsive layout for mobile devices

### 4. **Fixed Logo Loading Issue**

**Problem:** External logo URL not loading (ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED)

**Solution:** Created custom CSS-based Ndabase logo:
- **Login Page:** 
  - Colorful circular icon with 4 segments (red, teal, yellow, orange)
  - "ndabase" text in white
  - "printingsolutions" tagline
  
- **Navigation Bar:**
  - üé® icon
  - "ndabase" in orange
  - "IT Helpdesk" in white

### 5. **Enhanced Styling**

Added new CSS classes:
- `.tickets-table` - Clean table layout for dashboard tickets
- `.ticket-row` - Interactive row with hover effect
- `.ticket-info` - Ticket details section
- `.ticket-badges` - Priority and status badges
- `.priority-badge` - Color-coded priority indicators
- `.status-badge` - Color-coded status indicators
- `.ndabase-logo` - Custom logo components
- `.logo-circle` - Colorful wheel design
- `.logo-segment` - Individual color segments

### 6. **Color Scheme**

Priority badges:
- **Urgent:** Red background (#fee), dark red text
- **High:** Orange background (#fff3e0), dark orange text
- **Normal:** Green background (#e8f5e9), dark green text

Status badges:
- **Open:** Blue background (#e3f2fd)
- **In Progress:** Orange background (#fff3e0)
- **Resolved:** Green background (#e8f5e9)
- **Closed:** Gray background (#f5f5f5)

## üìä **How It Works**

### After Creating a Ticket:

1. **Helpdesk Officer creates ticket**
   - Redirected to tickets list after 2 seconds
   - Dashboard now shows the new ticket in "Recent Tickets"
   - Counters update automatically

2. **Technician views dashboard**
   - Sees ticket in "My Assigned Tickets" if assigned to them
   - Counters update (Assigned to Me, In Progress, Urgent)
   - Can click ticket to view/update

3. **Admin views dashboard**
   - Sees ticket in "Recent Tickets"
   - All counters update (Total, Open, Resolved, Urgent)
   - Full system overview
