- Lines 395-397: Had server log output appended at end

**Fix Applied**: ✅

## 🎯 Known Non-Critical Items

### Email Notifications (Not Blocking)
The server logs show email authentication errors. This is **expected** and **not critical**:
```
ERROR - Failed to send email: (535, '5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted')
```

**Reason**: Gmail credentials not configured in production  
**Impact**: Emails won't send, but all other features work perfectly  
**Fix (Optional)**: Configure real SMTP credentials in `app/config.py` when deploying
