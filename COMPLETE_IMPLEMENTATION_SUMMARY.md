## 🚧 REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION

### Priority 1: Enhanced SLA Monitor ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Current Status:** Basic SLA monitoring works, but needs enhancement

**File to Update:** `app/services/sla_monitor.py`

**Required Implementation:**
```python
def check_sla_breaches():
    """Enhanced SLA checking with auto-escalation"""
    active_tickets = get_active_tickets()
    
    for ticket in active_tickets:
        time_remaining = (ticket.sla_deadline - now).total_seconds() / 60
        
        # Update SLA Status
        if time_remaining <= 0:
            ticket.sla_status = 'Breached'
            handle_breach(ticket)  # NEW FUNCTION
        elif time_remaining <= 2:
            ticket.sla_status = 'At Risk'
            send_pre_expiry_alert(ticket)  # NEW FUNCTION
        else:
            ticket.sla_status = 'On Track'

def handle_breach(ticket):
    """Auto-escalate breached tickets"""
    # 1. Bump priority to Urgent
    old_priority = ticket.priority
    ticket.priority = 'Urgent'
    
    # 2. Recompute SLA (add 20 minutes)
    ticket.sla_deadline = now + timedelta(minutes=20)
    
    # 3. Set flags
    ticket.requires_update = 1
    ticket.escalated = 1
    
    # 4. Create escalation record
    create_sla_escalation(ticket, old_priority)
    
    # 5. Create audit log
    create_audit_log('ticket', ticket.id, 'sla_escalated', system_user_id, {
        'old_priority': old_priority,
        'new_priority': 'Urgent',
        'reason': 'SLA deadline exceeded'
    })
    
    # 6. Send notifications
    notify_assignee(ticket)
    notify_manager(ticket)
    notify_gm(ticket)
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Priority 2: New API Endpoints ⚠️ REQUIRED

**File to Update:** `app/api/tickets.py`

**Endpoints to Add:**
```python
@router.get("/tickets/{id}/check-blocked")
# Returns: {"requires_update": bool, "escalation_reason": str}

@router.post("/tickets/{id}/forced-update")  
# Clears requires_update flag after mandatory update
# Creates audit log

@router.post("/tickets/{id}/reassign")
# Requires reassign_reason in body
# Creates audit log

@router.post("/tickets/{id}/internal-note")
# Sets is_internal=1 on ticket_update
# Only visible to helpdesk & managers
```

**File to Create:** `app/api/escalations.py`

```python
@router.get("/escalations")
# Returns all escalated tickets with details

@router.post("/escalations/{id}/acknowledge")
# GM acknowledges escalation
# Creates audit log
```

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

### Priority 3: Remaining HTML Pages ⚠️ LARGE EFFORT

#### 3A. Technician Page (technician.html)
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

**Required Features:**
- Kanban board (4 columns: Open, In Progress, Waiting, Resolved)
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Forced update modal (BLOCKING when requires_update=1)
- Ticket detail panel with timeline
- Time tracking input on every update
- Reassign with mandatory reason
- File upload capability

**Libraries Needed:**
- SortableJS or similar for drag-drop
- Or implement native HTML5 drag-drop

#### 3B. ICT Manager Page (ict-manager.html)
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

**Required Features:**
- KPI calculation endpoints
- Chart.js integration
- CSV export functionality
- Audit log viewer
- Date range filtering
- Escalation management

**Libraries Needed:**
- Chart.js v4.x
- Papa Parse for CSV export

#### 3C. ICT GM Page (ict-gm.html)
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

**Required Features:**
- Escalations feed with acknowledge
- High-level KPIs only
- CC'd notifications inbox
- Read-only ticket view
- Investigation flagging

### Priority 4: Role-Based Routing
**File to Update:** `app/main.py`

**Implementation:**
```python
@app.post("/api/auth/login")
async def login(...):
    # After successful authentication
    redirect_map = {
        UserRole.HELPDESK_OFFICER: "/helpdesk-officer.html",
        UserRole.TECHNICIAN: "/technician.html",
        UserRole.ICT_MANAGER: "/ict-manager.html",
        UserRole.ICT_GM: "/ict-gm.html",
        UserRole.ADMIN: "/index.html"
    }
    
    return {
        "access_token": token,
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "redirect_url": redirect_map.get(user.role, "/index.html"),
        "user": user_dict
    }
```

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### What Works Right Now:
✅ Server running on http://localhost:8000  
✅ SLA monitor checking every 60 seconds  
✅ Ticket creation/update via original index.html  
✅ Helpdesk Officer page fully functional  
✅ User authentication and role checking  
✅ Database fully migrated with all new fields  

### What Needs Work:
⏳ SLA auto-escalation logic  
⏳ Forced update blocking  
⏳ Role-based page redirects  
⏳ Technician Kanban page  
⏳ Manager analytics page  
⏳ GM oversight page  
⏳ New API endpoints for escalations  
⏳ Email notifications (SMTP timeout issue)

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST WHAT'S BEEN BUILT

### 1. Test Helpdesk Officer Page

**Steps:**
1. Start server: `python run_server.py`
2. Open browser: http://localhost:8000/helpdesk-officer.html
3. Login with: helpdesk1@ndabase.com / help123
4. Test features:
   - Click "+ Create Ticket" button
   - Fill form and create a ticket
   - Try different filters (Today, Unassigned, Urgent, My Created)
   - Check technician availability panel
   - Observe SLA countdown badges
   - Wait 30 seconds and watch auto-refresh

### 2. Test Database Changes

**Verify new columns:**
```sql
-- In SQLite
.schema users
.schema tickets  
.schema ticket_updates
.schema audit_logs

-- Check data
SELECT * FROM users WHERE role IN ('ict_manager', 'ict_gm');
SELECT ticket_number, sla_status, updated_at FROM tickets;
```

### 3. Test New User Accounts

**Login as different roles:**
- Manager: manager@ndabase.com / manager123
- GM: gm@ndabase.com / gm123

(Currently redirects to index.html - needs routing update)

2. **SLA Monitor Errors** - Tries to query updated_at before migration
   - **Status:** FIXED - Migration completed successfully

3. **Role Redirect Missing** - All logins go to index.html
   - **Status:** PENDING - Needs routing implementation

4. **No Forced Update Blocking** - Escalated tickets don't block actions
   - **Status:** PENDING - Needs endpoint and frontend logic
