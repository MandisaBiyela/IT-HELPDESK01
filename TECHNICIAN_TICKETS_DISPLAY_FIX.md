# Technician Active Tickets Display Fix

## Date: October 16, 2025
## Issue: Technician Panel Not Showing Individual Tickets

---

## Problem
The "On-Call Technicians - Active Tickets" panel was showing the count of active tickets (e.g., "0 active tickets") but not displaying the actual ticket details for each technician.

**Screenshot Evidence**: Panel showed "Sipho Nkosi - 0 active tickets" without listing the actual ticket numbers.

---

## Root Cause
The `updateTechnicianPanel()` function was only calculating and displaying the ticket count, but not rendering the individual ticket details even though we had previously added that enhancement.

---

## Solution Implemented

### File: `static/js/helpdesk-officer.js`
**Function**: `updateTechnicianPanel()`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Ticket Collection
Instead of just counting tickets, now we collect the full ticket objects:

```javascript
// OLD: Only count
const load = techLoads[tech.id] || 0;

// NEW: Get full ticket objects
const activeTickets = allTickets.filter(t => 
    t.assignee_id === tech.id && 
    t.status !== 'Resolved' && 
    t.status !== 'Closed'
);
const load = activeTickets.length;
```

#### 2. Build Individual Ticket List
Added code to display up to 5 tickets per technician:

```javascript
let ticketsHTML = '';
if (activeTickets.length > 0) {
    ticketsHTML = '<div class="tech-tickets">';
    activeTickets.forEach((ticket, index) => {
        if (index < 5) {  // Show up to 5 tickets
            ticketsHTML += `
                <div class="tech-ticket-item">
                    <span>${ticket.ticket_number}</span>
                    <span class="tech-ticket-priority ${ticket.priority.toLowerCase()}">${ticket.priority}</span>
                </div>
            `;
        }
    });
    if (activeTickets.length > 5) {
        ticketsHTML += `<div class="tech-ticket-more">+${activeTickets.length - 5} more</div>`;
    }
    ticketsHTML += '</div>';
}
```

#### 3. Include Tickets in Card Display
The ticket list is now injected into the technician card:

```javascript
techCard.innerHTML = `
    <div class="tech-name">${tech.name}</div>
    <div class="tech-load">
        <span class="load-indicator ${indicatorClass}"></span>
        ${load} active ticket${load !== 1 ? 's' : ''}
    </div>
    ${tech.technician_type ? `<div>...</div>` : ''}
    ${ticketsHTML}  // ← Ticket list added here
`;
```

## Additional Styling

### File: `static/helpdesk-officer.html`

Added styling for the "+X more" indicator:

```css
.tech-ticket-more {
    font-size: 11px;
    color: #666;
    font-style: italic;
    padding: 4px 0;
    text-align: center;
}
```

---

## Features

### Display Logic
- ✅ Shows up to **5 active tickets** per technician
- ✅ Each ticket shows:
  - Ticket number (e.g., NDB-0001)
  - Priority badge (color-coded: Urgent/High/Normal)
- ✅ If more than 5 tickets, shows "+X more" indicator
- ✅ Only shows tickets with status NOT "Resolved" or "Closed"

### Visual Design
- ✅ Color-coded priority badges:
  - **Urgent**: Red background (#ffebee) with dark red text
  - **High**: Orange background (#fff3e0) with dark orange text
  - **Normal**: Blue background (#e3f2fd) with dark blue text
- ✅ Clean, readable ticket list with proper spacing
- ✅ "+X more" indicator in gray italics

## Example Output

**Before Fix**:
```
Sipho Nkosi
⚫ 0 active tickets
```

**After Fix**:
```
Sipho Nkosi
⚫ 3 active tickets
Software Technician
─────────────────
NDB-0001    [Urgent]
NDB-0003    [High]
NDB-0007    [Normal]
```

Or if technician has many tickets:
```
John Doe
🔴 7 active tickets
Hardware Technician
─────────────────
NDB-0001    [Urgent]
NDB-0002    [Urgent]
NDB-0005    [High]
NDB-0008    [Normal]
NDB-0010    [Normal]
+2 more
```

## Technical Details

### Filter Criteria for Active Tickets
```javascript
t.assignee_id === tech.id &&   // Assigned to this technician
t.status !== 'Resolved' &&      // Not resolved
t.status !== 'Closed'           // Not closed
```

### Display Limit
- Maximum 5 tickets shown per technician
- Prevents UI clutter for busy technicians
- Shows overflow count (e.g., "+2 more")

### Load Indicators
- 🟢 **Green** (Available): 0-3 tickets
- 🟡 **Yellow** (Busy): 4-6 tickets  
- 🔴 **Red** (Overloaded): 7+ tickets

---

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: Helpdesk officers can see exactly which tickets each technician is working on
2. **Quick Reference**: No need to filter by technician - see all assignments at a glance
3. **Priority Awareness**: Color-coded badges make it easy to spot urgent tickets
4. **Workload Balance**: Can quickly identify which technicians have capacity
5. **Efficient Assignment**: Can assign new tickets to less busy technicians

---

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. ✅ **Technician with 0 tickets**: Shows name and "0 active tickets" (no ticket list)
2. ✅ **Technician with 1-5 tickets**: Shows all tickets with ticket numbers and priorities
3. ✅ **Technician with 6+ tickets**: Shows first 5 tickets + "+X more" indicator
4. ✅ **Mixed priorities**: Urgent, High, and Normal badges all display correctly
5. ✅ **Resolved/Closed tickets**: Not shown in active ticket list

### How to Test

1. Login as helpdesk officer
2. Check the right sidebar "On-Call Technicians - Active Tickets"
3. Should see each technician with their assigned tickets listed
4. Assign a new ticket to a technician
5. Refresh - should see the new ticket appear in their list
6. Resolve a ticket
7. Refresh - should see the ticket disappear from their list
