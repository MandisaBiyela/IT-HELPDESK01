# "Waiting on User" Status - Implementation Fix

## Overview
Fixed the "[object Object]" error that appeared when technicians tried to update a ticket status to "Waiting on User". The issue was that this status existed in the frontend dropdown but was not recognized by the backend as a valid status.

## Root Cause

### Frontend vs Backend Mismatch
- **Frontend**: Technician HTML had "Waiting on User" status option in the dropdown
- **Backend**: `TicketStatus` enum only had: Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed
- **Result**: When technician selected "Waiting on User" and submitted, the backend returned a 422 Validation Error (Unprocessable Entity)

### Error Display
The "[object Object]" error occurred because:
1. Backend returned a validation error object
2. Frontend error handler tried to display `error.detail` 
3. The error detail was an object, not a string
4. JavaScript displayed it as "[object Object]" instead of a readable message

## Changes Made

### 1. **Backend - Ticket Model** (`app/models/ticket.py`)

#### Added WAITING_ON_USER Status
```python
class TicketStatus(str, enum.Enum):
    OPEN = "Open"
    IN_PROGRESS = "In Progress"
    WAITING_ON_USER = "Waiting on User"  # ✅ NEW
    RESOLVED = "Resolved"
    CLOSED = "Closed"
```

**Impact**: Backend now recognizes "Waiting on User" as a valid ticket status

### 2. **Backend - Reports API** (`app/api/reports.py`)

#### Updated Statistics to Include Waiting Status
```python
status_breakdown = {
    'open': len([t for t in tickets if t.status == TicketStatus.OPEN]),
    'in_progress': len([t for t in tickets if t.status == TicketStatus.IN_PROGRESS]),
    'waiting_on_user': len([t for t in tickets if t.status == TicketStatus.WAITING_ON_USER]),  # ✅ NEW
    'resolved': len([t for t in tickets if t.status == TicketStatus.RESOLVED]),
    'closed': len([t for t in tickets if t.status == TicketStatus.CLOSED])
}
```

**Impact**: ICT Manager dashboard statistics now track "Waiting on User" tickets separately

### 3. **Frontend - ICT Manager Charts** (`static/js/ict-manager.js`)

#### Added Waiting Status to Doughnut Chart
```javascript
charts.status = new Chart(statusCtx, {
    type: 'doughnut',
    data: {
        labels: ['Open', 'In Progress', 'Waiting on User', 'Resolved', 'Closed'],  // ✅ NEW
        datasets: [{
            data: [
                stats.status_breakdown.open || 0,
                stats.status_breakdown.in_progress || 0,
                stats.status_breakdown.waiting_on_user || 0,  // ✅ NEW
                stats.status_breakdown.resolved || 0,
                stats.status_breakdown.closed || 0
            ],
            backgroundColor: ['#0066cc', '#ff9800', '#ffd700', '#4caf50', '#666']  // Gold for waiting
        }]
    }
});
```

**Impact**: "Waiting on User" tickets now appear in the status breakdown chart

### 4. **CSS - Status Badge Styling** (`static/css/style.css`)

#### Added Yellow/Gold Styling for Waiting Status
```css
.status-badge.waiting-on-user {
    background: #fff9c4;  /* Light yellow background */
    color: #f57f17;       /* Dark amber text */
}
```

**Impact**: "Waiting on User" status badges display with distinctive yellow/gold color scheme

### 5. **Frontend - ICT Manager Filter** (`static/ict-manager.html`)

#### Added Waiting Status to Filter Dropdown
```html
<select id="statusFilter">
    <option value="">All</option>
    <option value="open">Open</option>
    <option value="in_progress">In Progress</option>
    <option value="waiting_on_user">Waiting on User</option>  <!-- ✅ NEW -->
    <option value="resolved">Resolved</option>
    <option value="closed">Closed</option>
</select>
```

**Impact**: ICT Managers can now filter reports by "Waiting on User" status
