# Technician Features Fix - Track Time & Reassign

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Track Time Feature Not Working
**Problem**: After saving time tracking, the system tried to reload the ticket detail panel using `currentTicket.id` but the function expected `ticket_number`.

**Fix**: Changed line 598 in `static/js/technician.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
await openTicketDetail(currentTicket.id);

// AFTER (Fixed):
await openTicketDetail(currentTicket.ticket_number);
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Time tracking now saves successfully
- ✅ Ticket detail panel refreshes automatically after saving
- ✅ Time entries appear in the timeline immediately

### 2. Reassign Button
The reassign functionality code was already correct and should work properly. It uses:
- `currentTicket.id` for the API call (correct - API expects integer ID)
- Proper error handling
- Form validation (minimum 10 characters for reason)

## How to Test

### Track Time Feature:
1. Login as a Technician (Sifundo)
2. Click on any active ticket
3. Click "Track Time" button
4. Enter time spent (e.g., 30 minutes)
5. Enter work description
6. Click "Save Time"
7. ✅ Should see success message
8. ✅ Time entry should appear in timeline
9. ✅ Detail panel should refresh automatically

### Reassign Feature:
1. Login as a Technician
2. Open any ticket assigned to you
3. Click "Reassign" button
4. Select another technician from dropdown
5. Enter reason (minimum 10 characters)
6. Click "Reassign Ticket"
7. ✅ Should see success message
8. ✅ Ticket should disappear from your list
9. ✅ Should appear in the new technician's list

## Cache Busting
Updated version number in `technician.html`:
- Changed from `v=2.6` to `v=2.7`
- Forces browser to reload the JavaScript file

## What to Do Now

1. **Hard refresh your browser**: Press `Ctrl + F5`
2. **Clear cache if needed**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`, clear cached files
3. **Test both features** to confirm they work

## Technical Details

### Track Time API Endpoint
```
POST /api/tickets/{ticket_id}/time-tracking
Body: {
    "update_text": "Work description",
    "time_spent": 30
}
```

### Reassign API Endpoint
```
POST /api/tickets/{ticket_id}/reassign
Body: {
    "new_assignee_id": 123,
    "reassign_reason": "Reason for reassignment"
}
```

Both endpoints expect integer `ticket_id`, not `ticket_number` string.

## Files Modified
1. `static/js/technician.js` - Line 598 (Track Time reload fix)
2. `static/technician.html` - Version bump (v=2.6 → v=2.7)
