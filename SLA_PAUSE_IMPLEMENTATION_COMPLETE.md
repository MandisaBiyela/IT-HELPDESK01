# ‚úÖ SLA PAUSE FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Problem Solved

**User Question:**
> "If the ticket is signed as urgent, but the technician is working on it, more like waiting for missing part, what can we do to make it not escalate but be able to wait the days the missing part will arrive and update it to resolved after fixing it?"

**Solution Implemented:**
‚úÖ "Waiting on User" status now **PAUSES the SLA clock**
‚úÖ Tickets won't escalate while waiting for parts/external factors
‚úÖ Remaining SLA time is preserved and restored when work resumes

---

## How It Works

### Scenario: Waiting for Parts Delivery

**Before (Problem):**
```
10:00 AM - URGENT ticket created (20 min SLA deadline: 10:20 AM)
10:10 AM - Technician diagnoses: Need replacement part
10:15 AM - Part ordered (3-day delivery)
10:20 AM - ‚ùå TICKET ESCALATES (even though nothing can be done!)
10:25 AM - ‚ùå More escalations, alerts, manager notifications...
          (Continues for 3 days while waiting for part)
```
**Result**: Unfair escalation, stressed technician, inaccurate metrics

**After (Solution):**
```
10:00 AM - URGENT ticket created (20 min SLA deadline: 10:20 AM)
10:10 AM - Technician diagnoses: Need replacement part
10:15 AM - Changes status to "Waiting on User"
          Updates: "Replacement part ordered - ETA 3 days"
          
          ‚è∏Ô∏è SLA PAUSES - 5 minutes remaining STORED
          
          ‚úÖ NO ESCALATION for next 3 days
          ‚úÖ Technician can focus on other tickets
          ‚úÖ No stress, no unfair alerts

Day 3:
02:00 PM - Part arrives
02:05 PM - Changes status to "In Progress"
          
          ‚ñ∂Ô∏è SLA RESUMES - 5 minutes remaining RESTORED
          
02:08 PM - Installs part
02:10 PM - Resolves ticket

RESULT: ‚úÖ ON TIME (wait period excluded)
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Changes ‚úÖ
**New Column Added:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN sla_paused_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```
- Stores remaining SLA time when ticket is paused
- Restores time when ticket resumes

### 2. SLA Monitor Update ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/services/sla_monitor.py`

**OLD Behavior:**
```python
# Checked ALL open/in-progress tickets (including waiting)
tickets = db.query(Ticket).filter(
    Ticket.status.in_([TicketStatus.OPEN, TicketStatus.IN_PROGRESS])
).all()
```

**NEW Behavior:**
```python
# EXCLUDES "Waiting on User" - SLA exempt
tickets = db.query(Ticket).filter(
    Ticket.status.in_([TicketStatus.OPEN, TicketStatus.IN_PROGRESS]),
    Ticket.status != TicketStatus.WAITING_ON_USER  # ‚úÖ Paused
).all()
```

### 3. Status Change Logic ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/api/tickets.py`

**Pausing Logic (TO "Waiting on User"):**
```python
if will_be_waiting and not was_waiting:
    # Calculate time remaining
    time_remaining = (ticket.sla_deadline - datetime.now()).total_seconds() / 60
    
    # Store it
    ticket.sla_paused_minutes = int(max(0, time_remaining))
    
    logger.info(f"‚è∏Ô∏è SLA PAUSED - {ticket.sla_paused_minutes} min stored")
```

**Resuming Logic (FROM "Waiting on User"):**
```python
if was_waiting and not will_be_waiting:
    # Restore deadline = now + stored minutes
    ticket.sla_deadline = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=ticket.sla_paused_minutes)
    
    logger.info(f"‚ñ∂Ô∏è SLA RESUMED - {ticket.sla_paused_minutes} min restored")
    
    # Clear stored time
    ticket.sla_paused_minutes = 0
```

### 4. Model Update ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/models/ticket.py`
```python
class Ticket(Base):
    # ... existing fields ...
    sla_paused_minutes = Column(Integer, default=0)  # NEW!
```

## How to Use (User Instructions)

### For Technicians:

1. **When waiting for parts:**
   - Open ticket
   - Change status to "Waiting on User"
   - Add detailed update:
     ```
     "Ordered replacement fuser unit (Part #XYZ123).
     Supplier: ABC Company
     Expected delivery: 2-3 business days
     Will install and test upon arrival."
     ```

2. **SLA automatically pauses:**
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Timer stops
   - üîï No escalation alerts
   - üìä Shows "SLA Paused" in dashboard

3. **When parts arrive:**
   - Change status back to "In Progress"
   - Add update: "Parts arrived, resuming work"
   - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è SLA timer resumes with original time

4. **Complete the fix:**
   - Finish repair
   - Change status to "Resolved"

### For Managers/GMs:

**Dashboard Indicators:**
- üü° **Yellow badge**: "Waiting on User"
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused icon**: "SLA Paused - X min remaining"
- üìù **Last update**: Shows waiting reason

**Reports Show:**
- Which tickets are blocked
- What they're waiting for
- How long they've been waiting
- Supplier/vendor performance

## Real-World Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Hardware Replacement
```
Issue: Desktop won't boot
Diagnosis: Motherboard failure
Action: Change to "Waiting on User" while new board ships (2 days)
Result: No escalation, resume when parts arrive
```

### ‚úÖ Awaiting User Response
```
Issue: Software installation request  
Diagnosis: Need to confirm which version (Pro vs Enterprise)
Action: Change to "Waiting on User" while awaiting email response
Result: SLA paused during user delay
```

### ‚úÖ Vendor Support Escalation
```

Result: No internal escalation for external vendor delays
```

### ‚úÖ Procurement Approval
```
Issue: Need expensive equipment
Diagnosis: Requires manager approval and PO
Action: Change to "Waiting on User" while approval pending

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Pause SLA
1. Create URGENT ticket (20 min SLA)
2. Wait 10 minutes (10 min remaining)
3. Change status to "Waiting on User"
4. ‚úÖ Verify: `sla_paused_minutes = 10` in database
5. ‚úÖ Verify: No escalation after 20+ minutes

### Test 2: Resume SLA
1. Change status back to "In Progress"
2. ‚úÖ Verify: `sla_deadline = now + 10 minutes`
3. ‚úÖ Verify: `sla_paused_minutes = 0`
4. ‚úÖ Verify: Escalation triggers after 10 minutes if not resolved

### Test 3: Complete Workflow
1. Create ticket ‚Üí pause ‚Üí wait 3 days ‚Üí resume ‚Üí resolve
2. ‚úÖ Verify: SLA shows "ON TIME" (wait period excluded)

- What happens next

‚ö†Ô∏è **SLA Time is Preserved, Not Reset:**
- If 5 minutes left ‚Üí paused ‚Üí resumed = 5 minutes left
- Not a way to get MORE time, just pauses the clock
