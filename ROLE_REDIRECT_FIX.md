# Role Redirection Fix - October 16, 2025

## Problem Identified

**You were absolutely right!** When I simplified admin to reports-only, I broke access for other roles:

- ❌ Technicians logging in → No Kanban board
- ❌ Helpdesk Officers logging in → No ticket creation
- ❌ ICT Managers logging in → No analytics

## Root Cause

All users were trying to use the same `index.html` dashboard, but it was configured for admin (reports only).

## Solution Implemented

**Each role now has their OWN dedicated dashboard page** and the login automatically redirects users based on their role.

### Role-Specific Dashboards

| Role | File | Core Functions |
|------|------|----------------|
| Admin | `index.html` | Reports, Statistics, CSV Export |
| Technician | `technician.html` | Kanban Board, Update Tickets, Create Tickets |
| Helpdesk Officer | `helpdesk-officer.html` | Create/Assign Tickets, Manage Users |
| ICT Manager | `ict-manager.html` | Analytics, Reports, CSV Export |
| ICT GM | `ict-gm.html` | Executive Dashboard |

## Code Changes

### Updated `app.js` - `loadDashboard()` function:

```javascript
async function loadDashboard() {
    try {
        currentUser = await apiGet('/api/auth/me');
        
        // Store user info
        localStorage.setItem('user_id', currentUser.id);
        localStorage.setItem('user_name', currentUser.name);
        localStorage.setItem('user_role', currentUser.role);
        
        // Redirect based on role
        switch(currentUser.role) {
            case 'technician':
                window.location.href = '/static/technician.html';
                break;
            case 'helpdesk_officer':
                window.location.href = '/static/helpdesk-officer.html';
                break;
            case 'ict_manager':
                window.location.href = '/static/ict-manager.html';
                break;
            case 'ict_gm':
                window.location.href = '/static/ict-gm.html';
                break;
            case 'admin':
                // Admin stays on index.html
                userName.textContent = currentUser.name;
                updateMenuForRole();
                loginPage.style.display = 'none';
                dashboardPage.style.display = 'block';
                break;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load dashboard:', error);
        handleLogout();
    }
}
```
