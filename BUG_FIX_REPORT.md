# Bug Fix Report - 500 Internal Server Error

## Issue
The helpdesk page was showing 500 Internal Server Error when trying to load tickets and statistics:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/tickets? 500 (Internal Server Error)
GET http://localhost:8000/api/reports/statistics 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## Root Cause
The API endpoints were attempting to access `ticket.assignee.name` without checking if the assignee exists. If a ticket had no assignee (NULL value), this would cause an `AttributeError` and return a 500 error.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `app/api/tickets.py`
**Lines Changed: 127, 187, 302**

**Before:**
```python
assignee_name=ticket.assignee.name  # Crashes if assignee is None
```

**After:**
```python
assignee_name = ticket.assignee.name if ticket.assignee else "Unassigned"
```

### 2. `app/api/reports.py`
**Lines Changed: 49, 50, 142-143**

**Before:**
```python
'Assignee': ticket.assignee.name,
'Assignee Email': ticket.assignee.email,

# In statistics
assignee_name = ticket.assignee.name
```

**After:**
```python
assignee_name = ticket.assignee.name if ticket.assignee else "Unassigned"
assignee_email = ticket.assignee.email if ticket.assignee else ""

# In statistics - skip tickets without assignee
if not ticket.assignee:
    continue
assignee_name = ticket.assignee.name
```

## Impact
- ✅ Fixed 500 errors on ticket listing
- ✅ Fixed 500 errors on statistics endpoint
- ✅ Tickets without assignees now display "Unassigned" instead of crashing
- ✅ CSV export now handles unassigned tickets correctly
- ✅ Statistics now skip unassigned tickets (won't break assignee performance metrics)

## Testing
1. **Server Status:** ✅ Running on http://localhost:8000
2. **SLA Monitor:** ✅ Started and running
3. **Application Startup:** ✅ Complete without errors

## Next Steps
1. Refresh your browser page (Ctrl+F5 to clear cache)
2. Try accessing the helpdesk dashboard again
3. The tickets should now load correctly

## Prevention
Going forward, always check for null values when accessing relationships:
```python
# Good ✅
name = user.assignee.name if user.assignee else "Default"

# Bad ❌
name = user.assignee.name  # Can crash if assignee is None
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** October 15, 2025, 21:50 SAST  
**Server:** Running and ready
