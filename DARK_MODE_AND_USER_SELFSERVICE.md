# Dark Mode & User Self-Service Features Implementation

## Overview
Two major features have been added to the Ndabase IT Solution system:
1. **Dark Mode Toggle** - Available on all pages
2. **User Self-Service Ticket Creation** - Any authenticated user can create tickets

---

## 1. Dark Mode Feature

### What Was Added:

#### A. Dark Mode CSS Variables (`static/css/style.css`)
- Added dark mode color variables
- Light mode colors remain default
- Dark mode activated via `.dark-mode` class on body

```css
body.dark-mode {
    --text-dark: #e0e0e0;
    --text-light: #b0b0b0;
    --background: #1a1a1a;
    --card-bg: #2d2d2d;
    --border-color: #404040;
    --modal-bg: #2d2d2d;
}
```

#### B. Dark Mode Toggle Script (`static/js/darkmode.js`)
- Floating button in bottom-right corner
- Persists preference in localStorage
- Auto-applies saved preference on page load
- Moon icon for light mode, sun icon for dark mode
- Smooth transitions between themes

#### C. Pages with Dark Mode Enabled:
- ✅ Helpdesk Officer Dashboard
- ✅ Technician Workbench
- ✅ ICT Manager Dashboard
- ✅ Senior Technician (ICT GM) Dashboard
- ✅ User Dashboard (new)

### How to Use:
1. Click the floating moon/sun button in the bottom-right corner
2. Theme preference is saved automatically
3. Works across all pages once set

## 2. User Self-Service Ticket Creation

### What Was Added:

#### A. New User Dashboard Page (`static/user-dashboard.html`)
- Clean, modern interface
- Shows all tickets created by the logged-in user
- "Create New Ticket" button
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark mode compatible

#### B. Backend API Endpoints (`app/api/tickets.py`)

**New Endpoint 1: Create My Ticket**
```
POST /api/tickets/create-my-ticket
```
- Allows ANY authenticated user to create a ticket
- Auto-fills user's name, email, phone from their profile
- User only needs to provide:
  - Problem summary
  - Problem description
  - Priority level

**New Endpoint 2: Get My Tickets**
```
GET /api/tickets/my-tickets
```
- Returns all tickets created by the current user
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)
- Includes ticket status, assignee, and priority

#### C. Updated Login Redirect (`static/js/app.js`)
- Users without specific roles (technician, helpdesk_officer, etc.) are redirected to the user dashboard
- They can immediately create tickets and view their history

### How It Works:

**For Regular Users:**
1. Login with their credentials
2. Automatically redirected to user dashboard
3. Click "Create New Ticket"
4. Fill in problem details
5. Submit ticket
6. Ticket appears on helpdesk dashboard instantly

**For Helpdesk Officers:**
1. See ALL tickets (including user-created ones) on their dashboard
2. Can assign, update, and manage all tickets
3. No difference between helpdesk-created and user-created tickets

## 3. Updated Files

### New Files Created:

## 4. Technical Details

### Database Considerations:
- Tickets created by users have `reported_by_id` set to their user ID
- No changes to ticket model structure required
- Existing tickets remain unchanged
- All existing functionality remains intact

### Security:
- Users can only create tickets in their own name
- Users can only view their own tickets
- Helpdesk officers and technicians can see all tickets
- Authentication required for all actions

### Real-Time Updates:
- User dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Helpdesk dashboard shows user-created tickets immediately
- No manual refresh needed
