## SLA Management

### Understanding SLA Deadlines

Each priority level has a resolution deadline:

- **Urgent**: 20 minutes
- **High**: 8 hours
- **Normal**: 24 hours

The deadline is calculated from ticket creation time.

### SLA Warning (2 Minutes Before Breach)

When a ticket is 2 minutes from its SLA deadline:
- System checks if it's still Open or In Progress
- Warning logged internally

### SLA Breach (Escalation)

When the SLA deadline passes:

1. **Automatic Actions**:
   - Priority escalated to next level
   - Ticket flagged as "escalated"
   - Compulsory update required

2. **Notifications Sent**:
   - üö® Urgent email to assignee
   - üö® Email to ICT GM
   - üö® Email to ICT Manager
   - WhatsApp alerts to all

3. **Required Action**:
   - Technician **MUST** provide an update
   - Cannot change status/priority until update given
   - Update should explain the delay

### Handling Escalated Tickets

If you receive an escalation alert:

1. **Immediately** open the ticket
2. Review the current situation
3. Add an update explaining:
   - Why the delay occurred
   - Current status
   - Expected resolution time
   - Any help needed

4. This clears the "compulsory update" flag
5. Continue working on resolution

   - Request help before escalation
