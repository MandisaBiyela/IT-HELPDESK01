## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/users/` - Create new user
- `DELETE /api/users/{user_id}` - Delete user

### Ticket Management:
- `GET /api/tickets?assignee_id={id}` - Get tickets filtered by assignee (Technician)
- `GET /api/tickets` - Get all tickets (Helpdesk Officer, ICT Manager, Admin)
- `POST /api/tickets` - Create new ticket (Helpdesk Officer, Technician)
- `PATCH /api/tickets/{ticket_number}` - Update ticket (Helpdesk Officer, Technician)

### Reports (Admin, ICT Manager, ICT GM):
- `GET /api/reports/statistics` - Get ticket statistics
- `GET /api/reports/tickets/export` - Export tickets to CSV

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Admin Simplification**: Admin role is purely for oversight (reports only), not operational tasks
2. **Helpdesk as User Manager**: Helpdesk officers are the gatekeepers for user accounts
3. **Technician Self-Service**: Technicians can create tickets when helpdesk unavailable, but cannot manage users
4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each role has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
5. **Workflow Integration**: Helpdesk creates → Technician updates → Managers view → Admin analyzes

## Next Steps for Testing

2. ✅ Test each role's dashboard individually
3. ✅ Test the complete ticket workflow (create → assign → update → view)
4. ✅ Verify user management works correctly
5. ✅ Confirm technicians can see assigned tickets
6. ✅ Validate reports and CSV export functionality

- No database schema changes required
- SA timezone (SAST UTC+2) already implemented
- SA user names already in place
- Server-side filtering already working for technician ticket visibility
