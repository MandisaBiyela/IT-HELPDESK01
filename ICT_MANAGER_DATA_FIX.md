# ICT Manager Dashboard - Data Not Loading Fix

## Problem
The ICT Manager dashboard shows "--" for all statistics and the data isn't updating.

## Root Cause
Browser cache is preventing the JavaScript file from loading properly.

## Solution

### Quick Fix (Do This Now):

1. **Hard Refresh the Page:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Ctrl + F5`)
   - This forces the browser to reload ALL files without using cache

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
   - Right-click on the Refresh button
   - Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
   - Click the "Console" tab
   - Look for any RED error messages
   - Share them with me if you see any

### If Still Not Working:

4. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Press `F12`
   - Click "Network" tab
   - Refresh the page (`F5`)
   - Look for:
     - `/api/reports/statistics` - Should show status 200
     - `/api/tickets` - Should show status 200
     - `/js/ict-manager.js` - Should show status 200

5. **Verify You're Logged In as ICT Manager:**
   - The page requires ICT Manager role
   - If you're logged in as a different role, it won't work

### Technical Details:

**What Should Happen:**
1. Page loads
2. JavaScript calls `/api/reports/statistics`
3. JavaScript calls `/api/tickets`
4. Data fills in the stat cards
5. Charts render with data

**Current Database Status:**
- ✅ 1 ticket in database
- ✅ 4 users in database
- ✅ Server is running correctly
- ✅ Backend endpoints working

**The Issue:**
- Browser is caching old version of JavaScript
- Version was updated from `v=4.0` to `v=5.0` to force reload

### Expected Result After Fix:

You should see:
- **Total Tickets:** 1 (or more)
- **Resolved:** 0 or more
- **In Progress:** 0 or more
- **Waiting on parts:** 0 or more
- **Escalated:** 0 or more
- **Avg Resolution (hrs):** A number (not --)

The charts should also show data.

## If You See These Errors:

### "Failed to fetch"
- **Cause:** Server not running
- **Fix:** Make sure server is running at http://localhost:8000

### "401 Unauthorized"
- **Cause:** Not logged in or token expired
- **Fix:** Logout and login again

### "Access denied"
- **Cause:** Not logged in as ICT Manager
- **Fix:** Login with ICT Manager account

### Charts not showing
- **Cause:** Chart.js library not loaded
- **Fix:** Check internet connection (Chart.js loads from CDN)

## Quick Test:

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('Role:', localStorage.getItem('user_role'));
console.log('Name:', localStorage.getItem('user_name'));
```

**Expected:**
- Token: Should show a long string (JWT)
- Role: Should show "ict_manager"
- Name: Should show your name

**If Token is null:**
- You need to login again

**If Role is not "ict_manager":**
- This page won't work for you
- Login with an ICT Manager account

---

## Still Not Working?

Try this manual test in browser console (F12 → Console):

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/reports/statistics', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('Statistics:', data))
.catch(err => console.error('Error:', err));
```

This will show you if the API is responding correctly.

---

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. ✅ Check console for errors
3. ✅ Verify you're logged in as ICT Manager
4. ✅ Check if data now appears
5. ✅ If still broken, share the console errors with me

The server is running and ready, the endpoints work, the database has data. The issue is just browser cache preventing the new JavaScript from loading!
