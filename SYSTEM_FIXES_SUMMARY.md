# IT Helpdesk System - Fixes & Configuration Summary

## Date: October 16, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Technician Ticket Visibility Issue - FIXED**
**Problem**: Technicians couldn't see tickets assigned to them on their dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was fetching all tickets and trying to filter them client-side, but the filtering logic wasn't correctly matching the assignee_id.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `static/js/technician.js` to use the API's built-in filtering
- Changed from `fetch('/api/tickets/')` to `fetch('/api/tickets?assignee_id=${userId}')`
- The API now returns only tickets assigned to the logged-in technician

**Code Changed**:
```javascript
// OLD - Fetched all tickets and filtered client-side
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/tickets/`);
const data = await response.json();
const myTickets = data.tickets.filter(t => t.assignee_id === currentUser.id);

// NEW - Server-side filtering
const userId = localStorage.getItem('user_id');
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/tickets?assignee_id=${userId}`);
allTickets = await response.json(); // API returns array directly
```
