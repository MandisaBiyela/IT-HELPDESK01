- Large, readable values (36px font-size, bold)

**JavaScript Implementation**:

    const solved = allTickets.filter(t => 
        t.status === 'Resolved' || t.status === 'Closed'
    ).length;
    const unsolved = total - solved;
    
    document.getElementById('statTotal').textContent = total;
    document.getElementById('statSolved').textContent = solved;
    document.getElementById('statUnsolved').textContent = unsolved;
}
```
